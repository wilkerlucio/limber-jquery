Limber jQuery is a set of jQuery and Javascript extensions.
The base of Limber jQuery is some core Javascript extensions (extensions to
Arrays, Objects, Functions, Numbers...), but it's only the begging, the Limber
jQuery wants to provide some high level widgets like dragable, lightbox,
resizable and other kind of usefull libraries to support Javascript needs.
